# java-labs: Creating the environment for Java development and Git - 2019-2020

## Netcat (nc)
- Windows OS
    - Download MobaXterm from [here] (https://download.mobatek.net/1242019111120613/MobaXterm_Portable_v12.4.zip) and extract the content. No installation is needed. Netcat is available if you click on "Start local terminal".

- Linux OS
    - Netcat should already be installed on your system.

## NetBeans IDE 8.2 for Java SE

- Download NetBeans from [here](https://netbeans.org/downloads/8.2/) and install it using default options.


## Git 

- Download Git from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and install it using default options
  > Note that for instance in Ubuntu systems you could download and install it by simply executing the following:
  
```shell
    sudo apt-get install git
```

- Basic configuration
    - In Windows OS, the following commands should be executed inside git-bash (`$GIT_HOME/git-bash.exe`):
    
```shell
    git config --global user.email "your_email@udc.es"
    git config --global user.name "Your Name"
```

> The following line illustrates how to set Sublime as the Git default editor, but you can use any other editor installed in your OS (you can download Sublime Text editor from [here](https://www.sublimetext.com/3))
      
```shell
    >Windows OS
	git config --global core.editor "'C:\Program Files\Sublime Text 3\sublime_text.exe' -w"
	
	>Linux OS
	git config --global core.editor "subl -w"
```

- [Optional]  Autocompletion utility for Git in Linux OS systems:
    - Follow instructions from [https://github.com/bobthecow/git-flow-completion/wiki/Install-Bash-git-completion](https://github.com/bobthecow/git-flow-completion/wiki/Install-Bash-git-completion)

### Creation and configuration of SSH Keys

- From the git-bash interpreter in Windows OS systems
> Generate SSH keys in the default path ($HOME/.ssh) and with default names
      
```shell
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@udc.es"
```    
    
- Open the browser and navigate to [https://git.fic.udc.es/profile/keys](https://git.fic.udc.es/profile/keys)
- In the "Key" field, copy the public key, i.e, content of file `$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`
- In the "Title" field, specify a name for the key
- Click on the "Add key" button

- Try SSH connectivity against the Git server and add it to the list of known hosts
  > Answer "yes" to the question "Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?"
   
```shell
    ssh -T git@git.fic.udc.es
```
